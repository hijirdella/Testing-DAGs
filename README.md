# Testing-DAGs
For this Data Engineer project, I implemented a testing workflow for Airflow DAGs. The project involves creating more than 5 tables in MySQL, extracting data to PostgreSQL, and managing the pipeline with dynamic DAGs. Jobs are scheduled to run every 2 hours between 9 AM and 9 PM on Fridays, twice a month (week 1 and week 3), at the 15th minute.
